# sage-wasm: Port SageMath to WebAssembly

- This will depend on [CoWasm](https://github.com/sagemathinc/cowasm).
- This will re-use some work from [JSage](https://github.com/sagemathinc/jsage) for building packages
- For now this is also a place to put notes and create issues with any information about efforts to port *any* components of Sage to WASM in any way.
